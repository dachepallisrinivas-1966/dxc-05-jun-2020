MS SQL Server
================
SQL Server is a relational database management system, or RDBMS, developed and marketed by Microsoft.
SQL server is tied to Transact-SQL, or T-SQL, the Microsoftï¿½s implementation of SQL

editions:
---------
1) SQL Server Developer edition - for use in database development and testing.

2) SQL Server Express Edition - for small databases with the size up to 10 GB

3) SQL Server Enterprise edition - For larger and more critical applications

4) SQL Server Standard Edition - partial feature sets of the Enterprise Edition and 
				limits on the Server regarding the numbers of processor core 
				and memory that can be configured.

SQL Server Management Studio : 
	IT is a GUI tool to work with MS SQL Server.

----------------
customers
	custno - (p), custname - nn, address, phone - (u)
items
-----
	itemno - (p), itemname - nn, unitprice - n(7,2) - should be non-zero and non-negative

how to display all tables present in the current database?
----------------------------------------------------------
SELECT *
FROM   information_schema.tables;

how to display structure of the table?
----------------------------------------
EXEC SP_HELP 'customers';

auto increment facility:
--------------------------
IDENTITY (seed, increment)


ALTER TABLE:
-------------
emp2 - empno int, ename v(5)

CREATE TABLE emp2
(empno	int,
 ename	varchar(5)
);

1) add a new column desg - v(10)
2) add two more columns basic - d(7,2), hra - d(7,2), da - d(7,2)
3) insert atleast 3 rows.
4) increase the width of ename to 10 characters.
5) decrease the width of ename to 3 characters.
6) delete hra and da columns
7) rename the column desg to job_title
8) add primary key constraint
    Note: to add a primary key constraint, the column should be defined as not null.
9) add a new column deptno - int

10) create another table dept2
deptno - int - (p), dname - v(10)

11) add a foreign key constraint on deptno in emp2 table.
12) add a check constraint for basic such that it should be minimum of 5000 and maximum of 50000.
13) drop primary key constraint
14) drop foreign key constraint
15) drop check constraint
16) drop emp2, dept2 tables finally.

SELECT:
-------
SELECT column-list / *
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY column-list]
[HAVING condition]
[ORDER BY column_list];

SELECT  job_id, job_title
FROM    jobs;

SELECT department_id, department_name
FROM   departments;

SELECT employee_id, first_name, hire_date, job_id, salary
FROM employees;


SELECT command can perform the following 4 operations.
a) arithmetic operations
b) column aliases
    alternate name given for columns in the output of SELECT command.
    column aliases must be enclosed within double quotes unless it is a single word.
    optionally we may use "AS" keyword after the column name in the SELECT list.

c) concatenated columns
    combining two or more columns.
    using concatenation operator ( + )  
d) literals
    literals must be enclosed within single quotes.
    it is repeated for each row in the output of the select command.

display annual salary for all employees excluding commission amount.

SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary, salary * 12 AS "Annual Salary"
FROM employees;

display full name for all employees.

SELECT first_name + last_name AS "Employee Name"
FROM employees;

SELECT first_name + ' ' + last_name AS "Employee Name"
FROM employees;


null:
-----
null means either unassigned, unpredicted or undetermined.
if a column value during insertion, by default it contain null value.
null is not same as ZERO.
it occupy ONE BYTE in the oracle internal storage overhead.
any operation performed with NULL value, leads to NULL result.


handling null values using ISNULL() library functions:
------------------------------------------------------
ISNULL(col/expr, non-null-value)
for every occurance of null value in the col/expr, is substituted with non-null-value specified.

display monthly salary for all emploees including commission amount.

SELECT employee_id, first_name,  salary, 
commission_pct AS "commission percentage", 
salary*commission_pct AS "Commission Amount", 
salary + salary*ISNULL(commission_pct,0) AS "Monthly Salary"
FROM  employees;

DISTINCT qualifier:
---------------------
eliminate duplicate rows in the output of SELECT command.

SELECT DISTINCT department_id
FROM employees;

SELECT DISTINCT job_id
FROM employees;

SELECT DISTINCT department_id, job_id
FROM employees;

WHERE clause:
---------------
it is for restriction operation.

arithmetic operators: + - * / 
relational operators : > < = >= <= !=  (or) <>
logical operators : and, or, not    

display all employees who earn salary more than 15000.

SELECT first_name, salary
FROM  employees
WHERE salary > 15000;

display all employees who are working department 50.

SELECT first_name, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 50;

display the details of Steven.

SELECT employee_id, first_name, job_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Steven';

display all employees who were joined on or before 31st december 2005.

SELECT employee_id, first_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date <= '31-dec-2005';

display all employees who are working department 50 and earn salary less than 10000.

SELECT employee_id, first_name, department_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 50
AND salary < 10000;

display all employees who are sales managers or who earn more than 10000.

SELECT employee_id, first_name, job_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE job_id =  'SA_MAN'
OR salary > 10000;

display all employees except purchase clerks.

SELECT employee_id, first_name, job_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE job_id != 'PU_CLERK';

SQL Operators:
-------------
a) BETWEEN value-1 AND value-2
b) IN (value-1, value-2, ...)
c) LIKE 'character pattern'
`   wild card character:

    %                   	represents 0 or more characters
    _	                    represents 1 character
    [list_of_characters]	any single character from the specified set
    [character-character]	any single character within the specified range
    [^]			            any single character not within the range


d) IS NULL

Negation Operators:
---------------------
a) NOT BETWEEN
b) NOT IN
c) NOT LIKE
d) IS NOT NULL



SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERe salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 15000;

SELECT employee_id, first_name, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (30,50,70,90);


SELECT employee_id, first_name
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '%n%';

SELECT employee_id, first_name
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '_o%';

SELECT employee_id, first_name
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '____';   (4 underscores)


display all employees who were joined in the year 2005.

SELECT employee_id, first_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date like '%-05';

display all employees whose first name begin with any alphabet between A and  D.

SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '[A-D]%';

display all employees whose first name begin with alphabet M, S or T.

SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '[MST]%';

display all employees whose first name do not begin with alphabet K, L or M.
SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '[^K-M]%';

display all employees who do not earn any commission percentage.

SELECT employee_id, first_name, commission_pct
FROM employees
WHERE commission_pct IS NULL;

ORDER BY:
---------
normally the order of retrieval of rows using SELECT statement is insignificant. However we can use 
ORDER BY clause to specify the sorting order. 
If used, it must be the last clause in the SELECT statement.

SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;

SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC, first_name ASC;

SELECT employee_id, first_name, department_id, job_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 50
ORDER BY 3, 4, 5 DESC, 2 DESC;

-- ORDER BY department_id, job_id, salary DESC, first_name DESC;


display all employees in the descending order of Monthly salary.

NULL handling:
--------------
Normally, the result of a logical expression is TRUE or FALSE. 
However, when NULL is involved in the logical evaluation, the result is UNKNOWN . 
This is called a three-valued logic: TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN.

The results of the following comparisons are UNKNOWN:

NULL = 0
NULL <> 0
NULL > 0
NULL = NULL

NULL is equal to nothing, even NULL is not equal to NULL because each NULL could be different.

truth table:
-----------------------------------
		TRUE	FALSE	UNKNOWN

TRUE		TRUE	FALSE	UNKNOWN
FALSE		FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
UNKNOWN		UNKNOWN	FALSE	UNKNOWN


IS NULL:
--------
SELECT
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    phone
FROM
    sales.customers
WHERE
    phone IS NULL		/* try to use phone = null instead and observe the result */
ORDER BY
    first_name,
    last_name;

OFFSET FETCH clause:
----------------------
The OFFSET and FETCH clauses are the options of the ORDER BY clause. 
They allow you to limit the number of rows to be returned by a query.

ORDER BY column_list [ASC |DESC]
OFFSET offset_row_count {ROW | ROWS}
FETCH {FIRST | NEXT} fetch_row_count {ROW | ROWS} ONLY

SELECT
    product_name,
    list_price

    production.products
ORDER BY
    list_price,
    product_name
OFFSET 10 rows;

(above query skips first 10 rows in the output)


SELECT

SQL Server subquery is used in place of an expression
-------------------------------------------------------
SELECT
    order_id,
    order_date,
    (
        SELECT
            MAX (list_price)
        FROM

SQL Server subquery is used with EXISTS or NOT EXISTS:
-------------------------------------------------------
The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery return results; otherwise it returns FALSE.

On the other hand, the NOT EXISTS is opposite to the EXISTS operator.

SELECT
    customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    city
FROM
    sales.customers c
WHERE
    EXISTS (
        SELECT
            customer_id
        FROM
            sales.orders o
        WHERE
            o.customer_id = c.customer_id
        AND YEAR (order_date) = 2017
    )
ORDER BY
    first_name,
    last_name;

SQL Server subquery in the FROM clause:
----------------------------------------
SELECT 
   AVG(order_count) average_order_count_by_staff
FROM
(
    SELECT 
	staff_id, 
        COUNT(order_id) order_count
    FROM 
	sales.orders
    GROUP BY 
	staff_id
) t;



Correlated Subquery:
----------------------
A correlated subquery is a subquery that uses the values of the outer query. In other words, it depends on 
the outer query for its values. Because of this dependency, a correlated subquery cannot be executed 
independently as a simple subquery.

Moreover, a correlated subquery is executed repeatedly, once for each row evaluated by the outer query. The 
correlated subquery is also known as a repeating subquery.

SELECT
    product_name,
    list_price,
    category_id
FROM
    production.products p1
WHERE
    list_price IN (
        SELECT
            MAX (p2.list_price)
        FROM
            production.products p2
        WHERE
            p2.category_id = p1.category_id
        GROUP BY
            p2.category_id
    )
ORDER BY
    category_id,
    product_name;
